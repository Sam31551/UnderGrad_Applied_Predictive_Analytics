# Is a football player's transfer value predictable?

## Basic Overview

This analysis considers player data from the computer game FIFA 22, to build, optimize and test a predictive model to identify the key features in a player's financial transfer/market value. This analysis will be useful to clubs trying to buy and sell players at suitable market values.

## Installation and set up

1. **Python Installation**: This project requires Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Running Jupyter Notebooks**: The Python files for this project are in `.ipynb` format, which can be executed using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. To use Jupyter Notebook locally, you can install it via Anaconda or directly using pip:
   - **Using Anaconda**: Install Anaconda from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and launch Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator.
   - **Using pip**: Install Jupyter Notebook with the command:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

3. **Required Packages**: This analysis requires several Python packages. You can install these packages using pip. The list of packages and their installation commands are provided below. 

      - `pip install pandas`
      - `pip install scikit-learn`
      - `pip install numpy`
      - 'pip install matplotlib`
      - 'pip install seaborn'
      - `pip install statsmodels`
      - `pip install xgboost`
      - 'pip install interpret'
      - 'pip install pydot'
      - 'pip install ipython'
      - `pip install scipy`
      - `pip install shap`
      
Once these packages have been installed all import statements should run.
